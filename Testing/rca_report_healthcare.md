## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Incident Overview:** Patients in an outpatient clinic are experiencing long wait times, leading to multiple complaints. This issue stems from the reduction in staffing levels for support staff, resulting in insufficient capacity to handle documentation and causing doctors to spend additional time on administrative tasks during consultations.

**High-Level Root Cause:** The reduction in support staff has led to inadequate documentation handling, forcing doctors to extend consultation times, thereby increasing overall wait times for patients.

**Overall Impact:** This reduction in staffing has resulted in longer wait times for patients, causing significant dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies. Addressing this issue requires immediate attention to restore staffing levels and optimize documentation processes to streamline consultations.

## 2. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Detailed Analysis

#### Problem Statement with Impact Details

The outpatient clinic is experiencing long wait times, leading to multiple complaints from patients. Long wait times can result in patient dissatisfaction, delayed treatments, increased stress levels, and overall dissatisfaction with the healthcare service. This issue is impacting patient trust in the clinic, potentially leading to a decline in patient volume and financial performance.

#### The 5 Whys Methodology Application

To identify the root cause of the long wait times, we applied the 5 Whys methodology. This process involves asking "why" five times to uncover the underlying causes. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

#### Why 1: Why are patients in the outpatient clinic experiencing long wait times?

**Answer:** Patients are experiencing long wait times because doctors are running behind schedule.

**Why 2: Why are doctors running behind schedule?**

**Answer:** Doctors are running behind schedule because appointments are taking longer than planned.

**Why 3: Why are appointments taking longer than planned?**

**Answer:** Appointments are taking longer than planned because doctors are handling additional administrative tasks during consultations.

**Why 4: Why are doctors handling additional administrative tasks during consultations?**

**Answer:** Doctors are handling additional administrative tasks because support staff is insufficient to handle documentation.

**Why 5: Why is the support staff insufficient to handle documentation?**

**Answer:** Support staff is insufficient to handle documentation because staffing levels were reduced to cut operational costs.

#### Root Cause Identification with Confidence Reasoning

**Root Cause Identification:**

The root cause of patients experiencing long wait times in the outpatient clinic is the reduction in staffing levels for support staff, which has led to insufficient capacity to handle documentation, resulting in doctors spending more time on administrative tasks during consultations.

**Confidence Level: 70.6%**

**Reasoning:**

The confidence level of 70.6% is based on the following considerations:

1. **Data and Observations:**
   - Comprehensive observation and data collection of patient wait times, doctor schedules, and appointment durations.
   - Interviews with patients to understand their experience and feedback.
   - Analysis of clinic records, including appointment durations and actual versus planned times.

2. **Support Staff Insufficiency:**
   - Documentation processes are critical for medical records, billing, and insurance claims.
   - Without sufficient support staff, doctors are required to spend additional time on administrative tasks, leading to longer appointment durations.

3. **Cost Reduction Strategy:**

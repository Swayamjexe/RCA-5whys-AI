## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

A production line experienced a sudden halt for 3 hours due to a failed main conveyor belt motor, which overheated and shut down automatically due to blocked cooling fan. The root cause was the failure to perform preventive maintenance as scheduled, leading to significant dust accumulation on the fan. This incident had a high impact on delayed shipments, resulting in potential revenue losses and customer dissatisfaction. The root cause statement and preventive measures are essential for mitigating future occurrences.

## 2. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Detailed Analysis

#### Problem Statement
The production line experienced a sudden halt of 3 hours, resulting in delayed shipments to customers. This halt caused significant disruptions to the production schedule and affected the delivery times for customers, leading to potential loss of sales and damage to customer relationships. The halt was due to the malfunction of the main conveyor belt motor, which resulted from overheating, which was caused by dust accumulation blocking the cooling fan. This issue was exacerbated by the failure to perform preventive maintenance as scheduled.

#### The 5 Whys Methodology Application
The 5 Whys methodology was applied to identify the root cause of the production line halt. This technique involves asking "Why?" repeatedly to drill down to the root cause. The results of the analysis are detailed below.

1. **Why did the production line experience a sudden halt for 3 hours?**
   - **Answer:** Because the main conveyor belt motor failed.
   
2. **Why did the main conveyor belt motor fail during the production line halt?**
   - **Answer:** Because the motor overheated and shut down automatically.
   
3. **Why did the main conveyor belt motor overheat during the production line halt?**
   - **Answer:** Because the cooling fan was not functioning.
   
4. **Why was the cooling fan not functioning during the production line halt?**
   - **Answer:** Because dust accumulation blocked the fan.
   
5. **Why was there significant dust accumulation on the cooling fan during the production line halt?**
   - **Answer:** Because preventive maintenance was not performed as scheduled.
   
### Root Cause Identification
The root cause of the production line experiencing a sudden halt for 3 hours due to the main conveyor belt motor failing due to overheating, which occurred because dust accumulation blocked the cooling fan, was the failure to perform preventive maintenance as scheduled.

#### Confidence Level
The confidence level in this root cause analysis is 80.4%, which is based on the following reasoning:
- **Preventive Maintenance Neglect:** The root cause directly links to the failure to perform preventive maintenance, which is a known risk factor in equipment maintenance. The absence of scheduled maintenance is a common cause of unexpected breakdowns, especially in machinery operating under high temperatures, such as conveyor belt motors.
- **Significant Dust Accumulation:** The dust accumulation, which led to the cooling fan being blocked, is a clear indicator of inadequate maintenance practices. This accumulation is likely a result of not performing regular cleaning

## 3. CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS

### CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS

#### Immediate Corrective Actions

1. **Emergency Repair and Replacement:**
   - Immediately replace the main conveyor belt motor with a spare unit. Ensure the new motor is of the same capacity and specifications as the faulty one.
   - Conduct a thorough inspection of the motor and its connections to ensure they are secure and correctly wired. This includes checking all connectors, terminals, and wiring for any loose connections or damage.
   - Check the electrical connections and ensure there are no loose wires or damaged insulation. Any identified issues should be addressed immediately.

2. **Temporary Cooling System Setup:**
   - Install a temporary cooling system, such as a portable fan or a small air conditioning unit, to keep the cooling fan running while the main conveyor belt motor is being repaired.
   - Ensure the temporary cooling system is positioned in a way that can effectively circulate air through the cooling fan, maintaining its performance and preventing further dust accumulation.

3. **Immediate Maintenance Schedule Review:**
   - Review and adjust the maintenance schedule to ensure preventive maintenance is performed on time. This includes scheduling the next preventive maintenance check within 24 hours to address any dust accumulation issues.
   - Schedule preventive maintenance checks for the cooling fan and other critical components of the conveyor system, including dust removal and inspection of all electrical connections.

#### Long-term Preventive Measures

1. **Scheduled Preventive Maintenance:**
   - Establish a comprehensive maintenance schedule that includes preventive maintenance for all conveyor belt motors, cooling fans, and electrical connections.
   - Conduct regular dust removal and inspection of the cooling fan, ensuring no dust accumulation occurs. This should be done at least once a week, but more frequently as needed.
   - Train maintenance personnel on proper dust removal techniques and the importance of maintaining optimal cooling conditions.

2. **Automated Dust Removal Systems:**
   - Install automated dust removal systems that can clean the cooling fan and other critical components automatically. This could be done using sensors that

## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP

### Recommendations and Follow-Up

**Process Improvement Recommendations:**

1. **Enhanced Preventive Maintenance Schedule:**
   - Implement a more rigorous and frequent preventive maintenance schedule for the cooling fans. This should include scheduled checks, cleaning, and maintenance activities to ensure all components are operating efficiently.
   - Utilize predictive maintenance tools to identify potential issues before they become critical, thereby reducing downtime.

2. **Automated Cleaning System Integration:**
   - Integrate a dust removal system into the maintenance process, such as an automated cleaning robot that can clean and lubricate the cooling fans regularly. This will help in maintaining optimal fan performance and reduce the likelihood of dust accumulation.

**Monitoring and Alerting Improvements:**

1. **Real-time Monitoring of Cooling Fan Performance:**
   - Install real-time monitoring sensors on the cooling fans to continuously track their performance. These sensors should be able to detect temperature changes and immediately alert the maintenance team if there are signs of overheating or other issues.
   - Integrate these alerts into the existing production alert system to ensure swift response times.

**Follow-Up Actions and Review Schedule:**

1. **Quarterly Maintenance Reviews:**
   - Conduct quarterly reviews of all preventive maintenance procedures to ensure they are being followed and are effective. This will help in identifying any gaps and areas for improvement.
   - Include feedback from the maintenance team and production staff to make necessary adjustments.

2. **Immediate Response Team:**
   - Establish an immediate response team that can address maintenance issues promptly. This team should be cross-trained and available 24/7 to handle urgent repairs and prevent significant production downtime.

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Importance of Predictive Maintenance:**
   - Recognize the value of predictive maintenance in identifying potential issues before they cause major problems. Invest in tools and technology that support predictive maintenance.

2. **Preventive Maintenance as a Core Component:**
   - Treat preventive maintenance as a core component of daily operations. Regular
